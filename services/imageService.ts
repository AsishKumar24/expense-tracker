        //file.uri is the file location
        //If file is an object, it typically contains metadata about the image.
        // In React Native (especially with Expo ImagePicker), the file object looks like:
        // {
        //   uri: "file:///some-path/image.jpg",
        //   type: "image/jpeg",
        //   name: "image.jpg"
             //an object
        //}
        //âœ… You need file.uri to extract the actual image path. If you just return file, it will not work because <Image /> expects a valid uri string.

        //but if both condition are false thewwn we use default png

        //FormData is like that lunchbox! Instead of food, it holds information (like your name, a picture, or a message).
// Then, it sends everything neatly packed to a website (just like your teacher taking the lunchbox to the picnic).
//
//Why is as any used?
// TypeScript expects the second argument of formData.append(name, value) to be either:

// A string
// A Blob
// A File
// However, in your code, the object being passed:
// {
//   uri: file?.uri,
//   name: file?.uri?.split.pop() || "image.jpg",
//   type: "image/jpeg"
// }
// is not a File or Blob. Instead, it is a plain JavaScript object.

// Since TypeScript will throw an error (because it doesn't match the expected types), as any is used to silence TypeScript's type checking, forcing it to accept the object.
//
//
// What is AJAX?
// AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique that allows web pages to send and receive data from a server without reloading the page.
// ðŸ‘‰ It helps create dynamic, fast, and interactive web applications by updating only parts of the webpage instead of reloading the entire page.

//It formats the data in the same way as a standard HTML form submission with enctype="multipart/form-data".
// //Why use FormData?
// It helps send form data dynamically via JavaScript without reloading the page.
// It automatically handles file uploads (e.g., images, PDFs).
// It supports appending multiple values for the same key (useful for checkboxes or multiple file uploads).
// It ensures the correct format for a multipart/form-data request.

// //What is multipart/form-data?
// multipart/form-data is a content type (MIME type) used to send files and form data in HTTP requests. It is commonly used when submitting forms that include file uploads.
// When a form is submitted with enctype="multipart/form-data", the data is split into multiple parts, allowing files, text, and other data to be sent together.

// Why is multipart/form-data Needed?
// Supports file uploads ðŸ“‚ (Unlike application/x-www-form-urlencoded)
// Handles binary data properly (Images, PDFs, etc.)
// Allows sending text + files in a single request
// Used in APIs, AJAX, and form submissions
